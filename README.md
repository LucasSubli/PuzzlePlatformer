# Puzzle platformer
A FPS project to learn how to conect UE4 to steam
The game in itself is irrelevant, just a box where players can run around


### Prerequisities

What things you need to have to be able to run:

* Unreal Engine - v4.19+
* Some C++ compiler and IDE (Visual Studio 2015+ recommended)
* Steam Online Subsystem and Steam Open when runiong the game


## Notes

This is a code for learning how to program on the unreal engine, do not expect anything more than some blocks shooting spheres at other blocks with made-in-2-min custom FX.
